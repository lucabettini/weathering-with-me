# [WEATHERING WITH ME](https://weatheringwithme.lucabettini.com)

<i>Completed and deployed on Github Pages on December 15, 2020 - new deploy on private server on October 2, 2021</i>

This website was created as a project for [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/).<br>

The requisites were:

- Show weather forecast from all over the world
- Search mode enabled both by location and by coordinates<br>

This website is built entirely using vanilla Javascript and bundled with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

I used the [Geocode API](https://geocodeapi.io/) to convert locations to coordinates and then used the [Openweathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get forecast data. The user can switch from different search mode using a link under the searchbar.

The layout was made using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and customized icons. **For additional documentation on layout choices look at [style.css](https://github.com/lucabettini/weathering-with-me/blob/main/styles/style.css).**
