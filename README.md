# WEATHERING WITH ME

This website was created as a project for [Start2Impact](https://www.start2impact.it/).<br>
The requisites were:

 - Show weather forecast from all over the world 
 - Search mode enabled both by location and by coordinates<br>

This website is built entirely using vanilla Javascript and bundled with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).<br>
I used the [Geocode API](https://geocodeapi.io/) to convert locations to coordinates and then used the [Openweathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get forecast data. The user can switch from different search mode using a link under the searchbar.<br>
The layout was made using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and customized icons. **Note: For additional documentation on layout choices look at .styles/style.css.**<br>
